# Monotonicity of the Hausdorff perimeter

For compact convex bodies `K ⊆ L` in the plane, `μH[1] (frontier K) ≤ μH[1] (frontier L)`.

The proof uses the nearest-point projection `nearestPoint K`, which is `1`-Lipschitz: every
boundary point of `K` is the image of a boundary point of `L` (push the boundary point of `K`
outwards along a supporting direction until it hits the boundary of `L`), so
`frontier K ⊆ nearestPoint K '' frontier L`, and Lipschitz maps do not increase the
one-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
