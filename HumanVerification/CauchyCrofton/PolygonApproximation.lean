# Polygonal approximation from inside

For a planar convex body `K` with the origin in its interior and any `r > 1`, a sufficiently
fine *uniform* angle system produces an inscribed polygon `P` with

```
r⁻¹ • K ⊆ P ⊆ K.
```

The construction uses the uniform angles `θ j = j * (2π / M)`, so the cyclic order of the
vertices is immediate.  The inclusion `r⁻¹ • K ⊆ P` follows from two elementary facts:

* `r⁻¹ • K` is at distance at least `(1 - r⁻¹) * ρ` from the complement of `K`, where
  `ball 0 ρ ⊆ K`;
* a ray hitting a chord whose endpoints have radius at least `L` meets it at radius at least
  `L * cos (δ / 2)`, where `δ` is the angle subtended by the chord.
