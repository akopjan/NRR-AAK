# Boundary nullity for compact convex subbodies

The frontier of a convex set in a finite-dimensional real normed space is Lebesgue-null. On the
plane this applies uniformly to every `NRR.ConvexSubbody`, including lower-dimensional
(degenerate) ones, since the underlying Mathlib convex body is convex.

The a.e. complement statement `ConvexSubbody.ae_not_mem_frontier` is the exact exceptional-set
lemma required by membership stability and area continuity: almost every point of the plane avoids
the frontier of a given subbody.
