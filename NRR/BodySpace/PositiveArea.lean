# `NRR.BodySpace` — lower-area subspace and the positive-area solid bridge

This module studies the closed lower-area subspace

```
NRR.BodySpace (K : Geometry.ConvexBody Plane) (A : ℝ) =
  {C : ConvexSubbody K // A ≤ C.area}
```

of the fixed-parent hyperspace `ConvexSubbody K`. Its elements are convex subbodies of `K` whose
area is at least `A`.

* The lower-area condition is closed (`continuous_area` and `isClosed_Ici`), so `BodySpace K A`
  is a closed subtype of the compact hyperspace `ConvexSubbody K`, hence compact.
* When `A > 0` every element has strictly positive area, so its carrier has nonempty interior and
  it can be repackaged as a solid geometry body `Geometry.ConvexBody Plane`. This solid bridge is
  continuous for the induced Hausdorff topology (via the named forgetful map
  `Geometry.ConvexBody.toMathlib`).
* Membership and a.e. indicator convergence lemmas are lifted from `ConvexSubbody` by composing
  with the continuous projection `BodySpace.body`.

`Geometry.ConvexBody.toMathlib`, and the resulting composite is the continuous projection to the
