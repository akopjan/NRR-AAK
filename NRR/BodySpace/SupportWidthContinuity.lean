# `NRR.BodySpace` — joint support-function and width continuity

This module proves that support functions and widths depend continuously on *both* the body and
the direction, for bodies varying in the fixed-parent hyperspace `ConvexSubbody K` and in the
lower-area subspace `BodySpace K A`.

## Core reusable lemma

The heart of the file is a body-parameter continuity criterion for the *solid* geometry bodies:
if a family `K : α → Geometry.ConvexBody Plane` is continuous for the Hausdorff-metric topology,
then it is a `SupportFunctionContinuousFamily` and a `WidthContinuousFamily`. The proof follows the
standard split of `h_{K a}(u) - h_{K a₀}(u₀)` into a *body-variation* term, controlled by the
Hausdorff–Lipschitz estimate `abs_supportFunction_sub_le_hausdorffDist_mul_norm`, and a
*direction-variation* term, controlled by the fixed-body direction continuity
`continuous_supportFunction`.

## Possibly-degenerate subbodies

The project support function `Geometry.ConvexBody.supportFunction` is defined only on the *solid*
bundled type `Geometry.ConvexBody`, whereas a `ConvexSubbody K` may be lower-dimensional. We
therefore work with the support function of the underlying compact convex set directly — the same
`sSup ⟪·, u⟫` formula as `Geometry.ConvexBody.supportFunction`, now for a possibly-degenerate
carrier — packaged as `ConvexSubbody.supportFunction`. It agrees with the geometry support function
whenever the subbody is solid. Its joint continuity uses the Hausdorff–Lipschitz estimate (whose
proof needs only carrier compactness and nonemptiness) and the fixed-body direction continuity,
both re-established here at the set level.

## Positive lower area

When `A > 0` every element of `BodySpace K A` is genuinely solid, so the solid bridge
`BodySpace.toGeometryConvexBody` lands in `Geometry.ConvexBody Plane`; the solid family predicates
follow from the core reusable lemma applied to the continuous bridge
`BodySpace.continuous_toGeometryConvexBody`.
