# `NRR.EMP.OptimalTransportCore` — the isolated optimal‑transport core

This module isolates the **single external mathematical dependency** needed to obtain
equal‑area power weights for a planar convex body: the existence of weights that make every
restricted power cell carry the average area `K.area / n`.

## The core theorem

```
theorem EMP.powerDiagram_equalArea_weights_exists_core
 (K : Geometry.ConvexBody Plane) (s : Fin n → Plane)
 (hn : 0 < n) (hs : Function.Injective s) :
 ∃ w : Fin n → ℝ, EMP.IsEqualAreaWeight K s w
```

This is the classical **Aurenhammer–Hoffmann–Aronov** (power / Laguerre diagram) existence
result, equivalently the semi‑discrete **optimal‑transport** existence theorem specialized to
the plane with fixed distinct sites and uniform (equal‑area) target masses: for a convex body
`K` of positive area and `n` pairwise‑distinct sites there exist additive weights `w` whose
Laguerre (power) cells restricted to `K` all have equal area `K.area / n`.

### Standard proof (convex‑optimization route)

The result is the first‑order optimality condition for a concave, coercive‑modulo‑constants
energy on the zero‑sum weight hyperplane `{w : ∑ i, w i = 0}`:

1. The map `w ↦ ∑ i, w i · (target_i)` minus the total power‑cell "potential" is concave and
 coercive modulo the additive‑constant direction (adding a constant to all weights does not
 change the power diagram; cf. `NRR.EMP.WeightShift`).
2. Hence it attains a maximum on the zero‑sum hyperplane (Weierstrass on a compact sublevel
 set / coercivity).
3. The gradient of this energy is exactly the vector of cell‑area deviations
 `EMP.areaDeviation K s w`, which is continuous (`continuous_areaDeviation_weights`)
 and zero‑sum (`sum_areaDeviation_eq_zero`).
4. At the maximizer the gradient (projected onto the zero‑sum hyperplane) vanishes, i.e. every
 cell area equals the common target `K.area / n`. That is `EMP.IsEqualAreaWeight K s w`.

The formal proof below uses the continuous area-deviation map, the coercivity estimate, and the
outward-field zero theorem. It is consumed by `NRR.EMP.exists_equalArea_weights` in
`NRR/EMP/EqualAreaWeightsExistence.lean`.

## Necessary nondegeneracy hypotheses

* `hn : 0 < n` — with no sites the target `K.area / n` is not defined meaningfully and the
 statement is vacuous/false for a positive‑area body.
* `hs : Function.Injective s` — the restricted power cells only tile `K` almost disjointly
 when the sites are pairwise distinct; coincident sites break the area bookkeeping. This is
 the same distinct‑site hypothesis carried by `sum_EMP_areaVec_eq_area` and
 `continuous_EMP_areaVec_weights`.

Core semi-discrete optimal transport theorem:
for an injective finite site configuration in a positive-area planar convex body,
there are power weights whose restricted power cells have equal area.
This theorem is the core existence result used by the equal-area weight API.
