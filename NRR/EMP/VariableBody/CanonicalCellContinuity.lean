# `NRR.EMP.VariableBody.CanonicalCellContinuity` — closed graph and continuity of cells

We upgrade the one-sided closed-graph result `isClosed_canonicalCellLowerGraph` to the *exact* graph
of the canonical power cell and deduce continuity of each cell and of the finite family.

* `CanonicalCellGraph` — the exact relation `{z | z.2 = canonicalCell sites hA hn z.1 i}`.
* `isClosed_canonicalCellGraph` — the exact graph is closed.
* `continuous_canonicalCell` — each canonical cell varies continuously in the Hausdorff hyperspace.
* `continuous_canonicalCells` — the finite family of cells varies continuously.

The exact-graph closedness combines the one-sided lower-graph inclusion with area continuity and the
convex-area rigidity of `ConvexSubbody.eq_of_subset_of_area_eq`: a Hausdorff limit `D` of the cells is contained in the limiting
canonical cell, both have the common target area `z.1.body.area / n` (positive since `0 < A` and
`0 < n`), so `ConvexSubbody.eq_of_subset_of_area_eq` forces equality. Continuity then follows from the
compact closed-graph criterion `continuous_of_isClosed_graph_of_compact` (both the parameter space
`BodySpace K A × X` and the codomain `ConvexSubbody K` are compact Hausdorff metric spaces), and the
family continuity from `continuous_pi`.
