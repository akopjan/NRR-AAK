# `NRR.EMP.VariableBody.ClosedGraph` — the compact closed-graph criterion

This module provides the abstract topological input that turns uniqueness plus a closed relation into
continuity of a selection map.

* `continuous_of_isClosed_graph_of_compact`: a function into a compact Hausdorff space, out of a
  compact Hausdorff space, whose graph is closed, is continuous. Mathlib does not carry this exact
  statement as a single named theorem, so it is proved here via the compact-projection route.
* `isClosed_graph_of_isClosed_relation_of_unique`: if a closed relation `R` contains the graph of `f`
  and selects each value uniquely, then the graph of `f` is closed (indeed equal to `R`).

The compactness of both the domain and the codomain is essential: the closed-graph theorem is false
for continuity without it.

/-- **Compact closed-graph criterion.** A map `f : D → Y` between compact Hausdorff spaces whose
graph `{z | z.2 = f z.1}` is closed is continuous.

Proof route: for a closed `F ⊆ Y`, the set `graph f ∩ (univ ×ˢ F)` is closed in the compact product
`D × Y`, hence compact; its image under the first projection is compact, hence closed since `D` is
Hausdorff; and that image equals `f ⁻¹' F`. -/
