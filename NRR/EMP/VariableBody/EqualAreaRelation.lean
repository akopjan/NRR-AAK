# `NRR.EMP.VariableBody.EqualAreaRelation` — closedness of the equal-area relation

Using the joint continuity of the area vector, the relation "the weight `w` is an equal-area weight
for the sites `s` inside the variable body `C`" is a finite intersection of zero sets and hence
closed, and adding the normalization `∑ i, w i = 0` keeps it closed. Composing with a continuous
site family yields the closed normalized-weight graph over any topological parameter space.

* `isClosed_isEqualAreaWeight` — the equal-area relation is closed.
* `isClosed_isNormalizedEqualAreaWeight` — the normalized equal-area relation is closed.
* `NormalizedWeightGraph`, `isClosed_normalizedWeightGraph` — the closed graph over a continuous
  site family.
