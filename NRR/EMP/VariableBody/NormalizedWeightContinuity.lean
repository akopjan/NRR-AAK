# `NRR.EMP.VariableBody.NormalizedWeightContinuity` — continuity of the selected weight

For a fixed planar parent body `K`, a lower area bound `A`, and a compact metric parameter space `X`
carrying a continuous site family `sites : SiteFamily X n`, the canonical normalized equal-area
weight varies continuously with both the subbody `C : BodySpace K A` and the parameter `x : X`.

The argument is purely topological, derived from the closed normalized equal-area relation
(`isClosed_normalizedWeightGraph`), uniqueness (`normalizedWeight_unique`), and the uniform
coordinate bound (`normalizedWeight_abs_le`); it does not use any pre-existing normalized-weight
continuity core.

* `normalizedWeightBox` — the selected weight, valued in the compact weight box.
* `isClosed_graph_normalizedWeightBox` — its graph is closed.
* `continuous_normalizedWeightBox` — the boxed selection is continuous.
* `continuous_normalizedWeight_compactFamily` — continuity into the ordinary weight space.
* `continuous_normalizedWeight_compactFamily_apply` — coordinate continuity.
* `areaVec_normalizedWeight_eq_target` — the selected area vector is the constant target vector.
* `continuous_areaVec_normalizedWeight_compactFamily` — continuity of the selected area vector.
