# `NRR.EMP.VariableBody.WeightBox` — a compact codomain for bounded weights

For a fixed arity `n` and a real bound `M`, the weight box is the subtype of weight vectors whose
coordinates are all bounded in absolute value by `M`:

```
WeightBox n M = {w : Fin n → ℝ // ∀ i, |w i| ≤ M}
```

Carrying the inherited subtype topology, the box is a compact Hausdorff space for **every** real `M`;
when `M < 0` it is empty, which is still compact. Identifying the defining condition with a finite
product of closed intervals `Set.Icc (-M) M` gives compactness from finite-product compactness of
the intervals (each interval is compact even when it is empty).

This compact box is the intended codomain for the equal-area weight selection, whose closed graph
together with uniqueness will yield continuity of the selection.
