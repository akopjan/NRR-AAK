# `NRR.EMP.WeightSpace` — finite‑dimensional algebra of normalized weights

This module packages the **pure, finite‑dimensional linear algebra** of weight vectors
`w : Fin n → ℝ`, independent of any optimal‑transport / power‑diagram machinery. It provides
the vocabulary used to pin down the additive‑constant freedom in equal‑area weights:

## Definitions

* `EMP.weightSum w = ∑ i, w i` — the total of a weight vector.
* `EMP.WeightNormalized w` — the affine normalization `EMP.weightSum w = 0` (equivalently
 `∑ i, w i = 0`).
* `EMP.weightMean w = EMP.weightSum w / n` — the arithmetic mean of a weight vector.
* `EMP.normalizeWeight w = fun i => w i - EMP.weightMean w` — subtract the mean, producing a
 zero‑sum weight vector.

## Main results

* `EMP.weightSum_zero`, `EMP.weightSum_add_const` — basic finite‑sum algebra.
* `EMP.WeightNormalized_normalizeWeight` — mean subtraction produces a normalized weight
 (for `0 < n`).
* `EMP.normalizeWeight_eq_sub_mean` — the definitional unfolding of `normalizeWeight`.
* `EMP.normalizeWeight_eq_self_of_normalized` — normalization is idempotent on already
 normalized weights.

This file must not depend on optimal transport; it imports only `Mathlib`.
