# `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody` — bundled compact convex bodies with nonempty interior

This module introduces the central bundled object

```
NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody E
```

a **compact convex** subset of a topological `ℝ`-module `E` with **nonempty interior**.
downstream modules are expected to use `ConvexBody` through the accessor/extensionality API below
without ever unfolding its fields.

## Relationship to Mathlib's `ConvexBody`

Mathlib already ships a bundled

```
_root_.ConvexBody V -- carrier, convex', isCompact', nonempty'
```

(see `Mathlib.Analysis.Convex.Body`), but its solidity requirement is only that the carrier be
**nonempty** (`nonempty'`), *not* that the interior be nonempty. The fair-partition
development needs the stronger *solid* condition (nonempty interior, hence positive
Lebesgue measure in finite dimensions), so we introduce a dedicated bundled structure whose
proof field is `interior_nonempty'`. To avoid clashing with the root `ConvexBody` used
elsewhere in the library, this structure lives in the `NRR.Geometry` namespace; the two
never collide because that namespace is not opened by the modules that use Mathlib's
`_root_.ConvexBody`.

## Design notes

* Typeclasses are kept minimal: the whole API only needs `[TopologicalSpace E]`,
 `[AddCommMonoid E]`, `[Module ℝ E]` (enough to state `Convex ℝ`, `IsCompact`, and `interior`).
 Finite dimensionality / inner-product structure is intentionally *not* required here and is
 added by downstream modules where genuinely needed.
* We coerce to `Set E` (via a `Coe` instance) and provide a `Membership` instance, but do not
 coerce `ConvexBody` to a type.
* No area/perimeter/measure fields, and no separate full-dimensionality field: nonempty
 interior already encodes solidity.

## Import policy

Following the library-wide policy fixed in `AI_CONTEXT.md`, this file
uses the whole-library `import Mathlib`. The concrete dependencies are lightweight
(`Convex`, `IsCompact`, `interior`, `Set` membership/extensionality).
