# `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody` — continuity of the planar perimeter

This module proves a **deterministic continuity theorem** for the planar (Cauchy) perimeter
`planarPerimeter` of a parameterized family of convex bodies `K : α → ConvexBody Plane`.

Since

```text
planarPerimeter (K a) = (1 / 2) * ∫ θ in 0..2π, w_{K a}(circleVec θ),
```

perimeter continuity reduces to continuity of a parameterized interval integral. The decisive
Mathlib result is `intervalIntegral.continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous'`:
if the uncurried integrand `(a, θ) ↦ f a θ` is (jointly) continuous, then
`a ↦ ∫ θ in a₀..b₀, f a θ` is continuous, for **any** topological parameter space `α`
(the measure `volume` has no atoms and is locally finite). No metric or first-countability
assumption on `α` is required, so the fully general `continuous_planarPerimeter_of_angleWidth`
holds and the metric fallback is unnecessary.

## The angle-width predicate

The hypothesis is packaged as the minimal predicate

```text
AngleWidthContinuousFamily K : Continuous fun p : α × ℝ => w_{K p.1}(circleVec p.2),
```

which is exactly joint continuity of the uncurried perimeter integrand. It is implied by the
stronger `WidthContinuousFamily` from `WidthFamilies.lean` (precompose with the continuous
reparameterisation `(a, θ) ↦ (a, circleVec θ)`), and holds for constant families.

## Design notes

* `continuous_planarPerimeter_of_angleWidth` wraps the Mathlib parametric-integral theorem and
 multiplies by the constant `1 / 2` (`continuous_const.mul`).
* The translation / scaling corollaries reduce to the *pointwise* transformation laws
 `planarPerimeter_translate` and `planarPerimeter_scalePos` from `PlanarPerimeterTransform.lean`,
 so the translation corollary needs no continuity of the vector field (perimeter is
 translation invariant).

## Import policy

`PlanarPerimeter.lean`, `PlanarPerimeterTransform.lean` and `WidthFamilies.lean` each transitively
pull in `import Mathlib`, so no extra imports are required.
