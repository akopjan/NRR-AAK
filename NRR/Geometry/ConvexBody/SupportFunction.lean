# `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody` — the support function

This module introduces the **support function** of a `ConvexBody` `K` in a real inner product
space `E`:

```text
h_K(u) = sup { ⟪x, u⟫ | x ∈ K }.
```

For a compact nonempty `K` and any direction `u`, the linear functional `x ↦ ⟪x, u⟫` is
continuous, so it attains its maximum on `K`; hence the supremum is finite and *attained*. The
support function is the canonical analytic interface to a convex body: width and perimeter are
later expressed through it.

## Design notes

* The definition uses `sSup` of the image of `K` under `x ↦ ⟪x, u⟫`, matching the mathematical
 formula. All order-theoretic boilerplate is discharged once, via the compactness maximizer
 `IsCompact.exists_isMaxOn`, which produces an `IsGreatest` witness for the image; from that the
 `sSup` characterisation, the attained maximum, the upper bound, and the least-upper-bound
 property all follow without hand-written epsilon arguments.
* The public API (`inner_le_supportFunction`, `supportFunction_le`, `exists_supportPoint`,
 the `sSup` characterisation, the zero-direction value, and congruence) does not expose the
 implementation detail that `sSup` is used; downstream files can treat `supportFunction` through
 these lemmas alone.
* We follow the library convention `inner ℝ x u` for the real inner product.

## Import policy

Following the library-wide policy, `Basic.lean` already pulls in `import Mathlib`, so no extra
imports are required here. The decisive Mathlib results used are `IsCompact.exists_isMaxOn`,
`IsGreatest.csSup_eq`, `le_csSup`, `csSup_le`, and continuity of the inner product.
