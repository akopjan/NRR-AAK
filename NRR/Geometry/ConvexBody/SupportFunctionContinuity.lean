# `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody` — continuity of the support function

This module proves that the support function `u ↦ h_K(u)` of a `ConvexBody` `K` is (globally
Lipschitz, hence) continuous in the direction variable. This is the analytic prerequisite for
width, Cauchy perimeter, and all later integration over the unit circle / sphere.

## Contents

* `exists_radius_bound` — existence of a radius `R ≥ 0` bounding the norms of points of `K`
 (from compactness / boundedness).
* `supportFunction_lipschitz_with_radius` — the quantitative estimate
 `|h_K(u) - h_K(v)| ≤ R · ‖u - v‖` whenever `K ⊆ closedBall 0 R`.
* `supportFunction_lipschitzWith` — the bundled `LipschitzWith` statement.
* `continuous_supportFunction`, `continuousAt_supportFunction`, `continuousOn_supportFunction`
 — full-space continuity.
* `uniformContinuousOn_supportFunction_of_isCompact` — uniform continuity on any subset (in fact
 the global Lipschitz bound gives uniform continuity everywhere).
* `continuousOn_supportFunction_on_sphere` — continuity restricted to the unit sphere, an
 immediate corollary.

## Design notes

The proof follows the preferred Lipschitz route: subadditivity of the support function plus the
radius bound `h_K(u) ≤ R‖u‖` give `h_K(u) - h_K(v) ≤ h_K(u - v) ≤ R‖u - v‖`, and symmetrically,
so the map is `R`-Lipschitz. This is more robust than a compact-maximum-with-parameters argument
and yields the strongest downstream API.
