# `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody` — support-function continuity under body parameters

This module provides the *body-parameter* continuity API for the support function. the project
established continuity of `u ↦ h_K(u)` in the direction variable for a fixed body `K`; here we
package the joint continuity of

```text
(t, u) ↦ h_{K_t}(u)
```

when a family of convex bodies `K : α → ConvexBody E` varies continuously in the parameter `t`,
plus the closure properties (constant, translation, positive scaling) that later
partition-cell / perimeter continuity arguments need.

## Mathlib hyperspace / Hausdorff situation

Mathlib *does* have a metric-space structure on nonempty compact subsets:

* `Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.HausdorffDistance` defines `EMetric.hausdorffEdist` and
 `Metric.hausdorffDist` on arbitrary sets, with the standard estimates.
* `Mathlib.Topology.MetricSpace.Closeds` upgrades this to bona-fide
 `EMetricSpace (TopologicalSpace.NonemptyCompacts α)` (and `Compacts`, `Closeds`), and
 `Metric.NonemptyCompacts.dist_eq` states that the resulting metric `dist` coincides with
 `Metric.hausdorffDist`.

However this instance is an *`EMetricSpace`* on `NonemptyCompacts`, not a `ConvexBody`-level
topology, and wiring a `ConvexBody E → NonemptyCompacts E` map plus its induced topology in just to
obtain joint continuity would be a much larger hyperspace development than downstream modules require.
We therefore take the two-pronged approach the design allows:

* **Route A (quantitative Hausdorff bound).** We prove the sharp Lipschitz-type estimate
 `|h_K(u) − h_L(u)| ≤ d_H(K, L) · ‖u‖` (`abs_supportFunction_sub_le_hausdorffDist_mul_norm`),
 which is the bridge to any Hausdorff-metric continuity statement one might want later. It is
 stated with `Metric.hausdorffDist` on the underlying sets, the current mathlib name.

* **Route B (abstract family-continuity predicate).** We define
 `SupportFunctionContinuousFamily K` as joint continuity of `(t, u) ↦ h_{K_t}(u)` and prove the
 closure properties (`const`, `translate`, `scalePos`) together with the evaluation and
 unit-direction restriction lemmas. Later constructions can discharge
 `SupportFunctionContinuousFamily` directly for whatever concrete family they build.

**Hausdorff–Lipschitz estimate for the support function.** For two convex bodies the support
functions differ by at most `d_H(K, L) · ‖u‖`, where `d_H` is `Metric.hausdorffDist` on the
underlying sets. This is the bridge to Hausdorff-metric continuity of the support function.
