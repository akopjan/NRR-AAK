# `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody` — width continuity for parameterized families

This module packages the **joint continuity of the width function** for a family of convex
bodies `K : α → ConvexBody E` varying continuously in a parameter `t`. Concretely we introduce

```text
WidthContinuousFamily K : Continuous fun p : α × E => widthFunction (K p.1) p.2
```

the width-function analogue of `SupportFunctionContinuousFamily` from
`SupportFunctionParametric.lean`, and provide the standard closure properties needed by later
partition-cell / perimeter continuity arguments:

* `WidthContinuousFamily.of_support` — a support-function continuous family is width continuous,
* `WidthContinuousFamily.const` — constant families,
* `WidthContinuousFamily.translate` — translation by a continuous vector field, and
* `WidthContinuousFamily.scalePos` — positive scaling by a continuous factor.

## Design notes

Everything reduces to the width transformation identities from `WidthIdentities.lean`
(`widthFunction_translate`, `widthFunction_scalePos_body`) and to `SupportFunctionContinuousFamily`
from `SupportFunctionParametric.lean`:

* `of_support` writes `w = h(t, u) + h(t, -u)`, where the second summand is the joint support map
 precomposed with the continuous reparameterisation `(t, u) ↦ (t, -u)`.
* `translate` is immediate: width is translation invariant, so the translated family is the *same*
 function of `(t, u)` as the original width family (`ha` is not needed but is included for a uniform interface).
* `scalePos` uses `widthFunction_scalePos_body` to rewrite the family as `(t, u) ↦ r t · w_{K_t}(u)`
 and takes the product of the (continuous) scalar with the width map.

No structure internals or `sSup` are unfolded here.

## Import policy

`WidthContinuity.lean`, `WidthIdentities.lean` and `SupportFunctionParametric.lean` (all
transitively via `Basic.lean`) already pull in `import Mathlib`, so no extra imports are required.

/-- A family of convex bodies `K : α → ConvexBody E` is a *width continuous family* if the map
`(t, u) ↦ w_{K_t}(u)` is (jointly) continuous. This is the width-function analogue of
`SupportFunctionContinuousFamily`. -/
def WidthContinuousFamily (K : α → ConvexBody E) : Prop :=
  Continuous fun p : α × E => widthFunction (K p.1) p.2

    Continuous fun p : α × E => widthFunction (K p.1) p.2 :=

/-- **From a support-function continuous family.** If `(t, u) ↦ h_{K_t}(u)` is jointly continuous,
then so is `(t, u) ↦ w_{K_t}(u) = h_{K_t}(u) + h_{K_t}(-u)`. -/

theorem WidthContinuousFamily.const (K : ConvexBody E) :
    WidthContinuousFamily (fun _ : α => K) :=
  WidthContinuousFamily.of_support (SupportFunctionContinuousFamily.const K)

/-- **Translated family.** Translating a continuous family by a continuous vector field keeps it a
width continuous family. Since width is translation invariant, the translated family is the same
function of `(t, u)` as the original; the continuity hypothesis `ha` on the vector field is not
needed but is included for a uniform interface. -/

  unfold WidthContinuousFamily at hK ⊢
  simpa only [widthFunction_translate] using hK

/-- **Positively scaled family.** Scaling a continuous family by a continuous positive function
keeps it a width continuous family, using `w_{rK}(u) = r · w_K(u)`. -/
