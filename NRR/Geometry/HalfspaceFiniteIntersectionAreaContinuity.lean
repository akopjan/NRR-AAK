# `NRR.Geometry.HalfspaceFiniteIntersectionAreaContinuity`

Area continuity for **finite intersections of fixed-normal moving halfspaces**.

For a finite index type `ι`, fixed normals `u : ι → Plane` and offsets `c : ι → ℝ`, the set
`finiteHalfspaceIntersection K u c` is the intersection of a planar convex body `K` with the
finitely many closed lower halfspaces `{x | ⟪u i, x⟫ ≤ c i}`, kept purely as a `Set Plane`
(never bundled as a `ConvexBody`). Its real-valued Lebesgue area is
`finiteHalfspaceIntersectionArea K u c`.

The main result `continuous_finiteHalfspaceIntersectionArea` states that this area depends
continuously on continuously-moving offsets.

## The nondegeneracy hypothesis `∀ i, u i ≠ 0` is necessary

Just as in the single-halfspace case (`continuous_cutAreaLower_fixedNormal`), the hypothesis
`u i ≠ 0` for each `i` is *mathematically required*, and its absence would make the theorem
**false**. Indeed, if some `u i = 0` then `lowerClosedHalfspace 0 (c i) = {x | 0 ≤ c i}`, which
is the whole plane for `c i ≥ 0` and empty for `c i < 0`. Taking a single index with `u 0 = 0`
and offset `c a 0 = a`, the intersection area jumps from `0` (for `a < 0`) to `K.area > 0`
(for `a ≥ 0`) at `a = 0`, hence is discontinuous. The corresponding "boundary slice"
`{x | ⟪0, x⟫ = 0}` is the whole plane, which is not null, so the boundary-null argument breaks
down exactly where the result fails. We therefore keep `∀ i, u i ≠ 0` explicit; this is how the
degenerate normal is *handled* rather than omitted.

## Proof route

The offset-to-area map factors as `A ∘ c` where
`A : (ι → ℝ) → ℝ, A f = finiteHalfspaceIntersectionArea K u f`. Since `ι` is finite, `ι → ℝ` is a
(first-countable, metrizable) product space, so `Continuous A` follows from
`MeasureTheory.continuous_of_dominated`:

* the area is the integral of the indicator of the (measurable, `K`-contained) intersection;
* the integrands are dominated by the integrable indicator `1_K` (finite, `K` compact);
* for a.e. `x`, the map `f ↦ 1_{∀ i, ⟪u i, x⟫ ≤ f i}` is continuous (in fact locally constant)
 at any `f₀` — it can fail only on the finite union of boundary hyperplanes
 `⋃ i {x | ⟪u i, x⟫ = f₀ i}`, which is null because each `u i ≠ 0`.

Continuity for an arbitrary topological domain `α` is then obtained by composing with the
continuous offset map `c : α → ι → ℝ`, so no first-countability hypothesis on `α` is needed.
