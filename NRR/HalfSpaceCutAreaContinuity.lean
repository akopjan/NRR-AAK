# `NRR.HalfSpaceCutAreaContinuity` — continuity of fixed-normal cut areas

For a fixed nonzero normal direction `u`, this module proves that the real-valued cut-area
functionals `cutAreaLower K u ·` and `cutAreaUpper K u ·` (defined in
`NRR.HalfSpaceCutArea`) are **continuous** functions of the threshold `c : ℝ`.

## The nondegeneracy hypothesis `u ≠ 0` is necessary

The hypothesis `u ≠ 0` is not a technical convenience — it is *mathematically required*. When
`u = 0` we have `⟪0, x⟫ = 0` for every `x`, so
`lowerClosedHalfspace 0 c = {x | 0 ≤ c}`, which equals `∅` for `c < 0` and the whole plane for
`c ≥ 0`. Hence `cutAreaLower K 0 c` is the step function that jumps from `0` to `K.area` at
`c = 0`; since a solid convex body has strictly positive area, this function is genuinely
**discontinuous** at `c = 0`. (Equivalently: the "boundary slice" `{x | ⟪0, x⟫ = c}` at `c = 0`
is the whole plane, which is *not* null, so the boundary-null argument below breaks down exactly
where the result fails.) Stating the theorems without `u ≠ 0` would therefore be stating a false
proposition, so the hypothesis is kept explicit. This is how the `u = 0` case is *handled*
rather than omitted.

## Proof route

The cut area is written as an integral of an indicator,
`cutAreaLower K u c = ∫ x, ((K : Set Plane) ∩ lowerClosedHalfspace u c).indicator (fun _ => 1) x`,
and continuity in `c` follows from `MeasureTheory.continuousAt_of_dominated`:

* the integrands are dominated by the integrable indicator `1_K` (finite because `K` is compact);
* for a.e. `x`, the map `c ↦ 1_{⟪u,x⟫ ≤ c}` is continuous at any point `c₀` — it fails only on the
 slice `{x ∈ K | ⟪u, x⟫ = c₀}`, which is null by `lowerCut_boundary_null` (needs `u ≠ 0`).
