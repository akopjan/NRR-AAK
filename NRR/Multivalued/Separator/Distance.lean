# `NRR.Multivalued.Separator.Distance` — distance to a closed nonempty set

Thin project wrappers around `Metric.infDist` packaging the metric facts used by the
signed-distance construction: continuity, vanishing on the underlying set, strict positivity
outside a closed nonempty set, the membership characterization of zero distance, and the estimate
by the distance to any chosen point of the set.

All results are stated for a general metric space; no compactness is assumed. Positivity requires
both closedness and nonemptiness of the set.
