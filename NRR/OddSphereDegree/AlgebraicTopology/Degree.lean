# Topological degree relative to a sphere orientation

Defines the transport from the project sphere model to `TopCat.sphere`, the
induced endomorphism on top singular homology, and the integer scalar obtained
after choosing an isomorphism from top homology to `ℤ`. The resulting
`degreeOfIso` API includes identity, composition, and independence of the
chosen orientation isomorphism. Unconditional orientation data is supplied by
later sphere-homology modules.

/-! ## Orientation of the ambient antipodal map

The orientation/determinant facts about the ambient linear map `x ↦ -x` on
`ℝ^(n+1)`. The bundled antipodal self-map `antipodal n` is the restriction of
this ambient map to the unit sphere, and its determinant `(-1)^(n+1)` is the
orientation sign that the topological degree `degree (antipodal n)` must
reproduce. These facts are degree/orientation support — not point-set foundation
— so they live here rather than in `Antipodal.lean`. -/

/-- The ambient antipodal map `x ↦ -x` on `ℝ^(n+1)`, as a linear endomorphism,
equals scalar multiplication by `-1`. This is the linear-algebra shadow of the
bundled `antipodal n` self-map (which is its restriction to the unit sphere). -/

This is the ambient orientation calculation used by the later theorem

sphere of this linear map, and its determinant gives the expected degree sign. -/
