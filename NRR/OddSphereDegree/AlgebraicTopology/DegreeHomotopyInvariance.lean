# Homotopy invariance of the topological degree — unconditional

Now that the singular prism operator is a theorem (`singularPrismOperator`,
established in `SingularHomologyHomotopyInvariance.lean` from the backported
algebraic prism and the library cylinder), the homotopy-invariance wrappers of
`Degree.lean` — which were stated conditionally on `SingularPrismOperator` — are
**unconditional**.
