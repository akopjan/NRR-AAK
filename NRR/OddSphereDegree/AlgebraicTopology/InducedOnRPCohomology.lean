# Pullback on singular cohomology of the descended odd map

This file connects the library's two finished layers — the **genuine** singular
cohomology functor of `SingularCohomology.lean` and the **genuine** odd-map
descent / double-cover API of `RealProjectiveSpace.lean` — into honest,
formalized statements about the pullback action of the descended odd map on the
real `mod-2` singular cohomology of real projective space.

Everything here is a real mathematical object:

* `rpCohomology n k` and `sphereCohomology n k` are the actual
 `k`-th singular cohomology `ModuleCat (ZMod 2)`-objects of `RP n` and `S^n`,
 obtained by applying the constructed functor `singularCohomologyZMod2 k` to the
 genuine `TopCat` objects `TopCat.of (RP n)` and `TopCat.of (Sphere n)`;
* `inducedOnRPPullback f hf k`, `projPullback n k`, and `spherePullback f k` are
 the actual pullback `ModuleCat (ZMod 2)`-morphisms induced by the descended odd
 map `inducedOnRP f hf`, the double cover `proj n`, and an odd map `f`,
 respectively. They are the functor's action on the opposite of the
 corresponding `TopCat` morphisms; their naturality is structural.

 The degree-1 generator `α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)`, its powers `αⁿ`, the cup
product, and the top-class / degree comparison remain genuinely absent (they need
the universal coefficient theorem, the Alexander–Whitney cup product, and the
transfer/Gysin comparison — implemented by the project modules listed below).

## What is proved here

* `inducedOnRPPullback_id` — the pullback of the descended identity is the
 identity on `H^k(RP n; F₂)` (functoriality at the identity).
* `inducedOnRPPullback_comp` — contravariant functoriality of the descended
 pullback: `(g ∘ f)bar^* = gbar^* ≫ fbar^*` (note the reversal).
* `inducedOnRP_pullback_naturality` — the **naturality square** of the double
 cover:
 ```text
 fbar^* ≫ proj^* = proj^* ≫ f^* on H^k(RP n; F₂) ⟶ H^k(S^n; F₂)
 ```
 This is the cohomological form of the commuting square
 `inducedOnRP_comp_proj` (`fbar ∘ proj = proj ∘ f`); it is exactly the
 square used by the top-class / degree comparison (`C3b`).
* `proj_pullback_antipodal` — the nontrivial deck transformation (the antipodal
 map) acts trivially on the image of `proj^*`: `proj^* ≫ antipodal^* = proj^*`.
* `inducedOnRPPullback_antipodal` — the descended antipodal pullback is the
 identity (a corollary of `inducedOnRP_antipodal` and `inducedOnRPPullback_id`).

These are the functorial pullback / double-cover-compatibility / descended-map
naturality facts independent of the cup-product ring computation.

The hypothesis is phrased on the descended maps `inducedOnRP f hf` and
`inducedOnRP g hg` (their `Homotopic`ness on `RP n`), since a homotopy on the
sphere need not be odd and hence need not descend on its own. -/

If a degree-one mod-2 cochain `φ` on `RP n` is fixed by the cochain pullback of the
descended odd map `fbar = inducedOnRP f hf` (i.e. `fbar^* φ = φ`), then so are all
its cup powers: `fbar^*(φⁿ) = φⁿ`.

This is the **cochain-level** form of the final-theorem target
`fbar^*(α)=α ⟹ fbar^*(αⁿ)=αⁿ` for the descended odd map, specialized to the
`ZMod 2` coefficients of the `RP n` computation. The cohomology-level version is
`inducedOnRP_cohPullback_cupPow_fixed` below (the cup product now descends to
cohomology, see `CohomologyCupProduct.lean`); the degree-1 class
`α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)` itself remains gated on the universal coefficient theorem, so no
unsupported `α` is introduced. -/

If a degree-one mod-2 cohomology class `a ∈ H¹(RP n; F₂)` is fixed by the pullback
of the descended odd map `fbar = inducedOnRP f hf` (i.e. `fbar^* a = a`), then so
are all its cup powers: `fbar^*(aⁿ) = aⁿ`.

This is the cohomology-level implication `fbar^*(α)=α ⟹ fbar^*(αⁿ)=αⁿ`, using
the `ZMod 2` cup product `cupZMod2` and its powers `cupPowZMod2` from
`CohomologyCupProduct.lean`. -/

The descended-odd-map pullback is multiplicative for the `ZMod 2` cohomology cup
product: `fbar^*(a ⌣ b) = fbar^* a ⌣ fbar^* b` for `fbar = inducedOnRP f hf`.

This is the `RP n`-specialized form of `cohPullback_cupZMod2`, stated directly in
terms of `inducedOnRPPullback` (which is `cohPullback (TopCat.ofHom (inducedOnRP
f hf))` by `inducedOnRPPullback_eq_cohPullback`). -/

`fbar^*(aⁿ) = (fbar^* a)ⁿ` for a degree-one class `a ∈ H¹(RP n; F₂)` and the

This is the `RP n`-specialized form of `cohPullback_cupPowZMod2`, stated directly

`fbar^* a = a` it yields `inducedOnRP_cohPullback_cupPow_fixed`. -/
