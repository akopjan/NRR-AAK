# Smallness/carrier control of the subdivision homotopy terms

This file proves the *carrier control* needed for the small-simplices
quasi-isomorphism: the chain-homotopy witnesses relating iterated barycentric
subdivision to the identity become small (with respect to a given open cover)
when applied to small chains.

The accumulated homotopy operator was built in
`BarycentricSubdivisionIter.lean` as

```text
H^(N) = barycentricSubdivisionIterHomotopyLinearMap R X N
 = Σ_{r=0}^{N-1} (sd^r) ∘ H,
```

with `H = barycentricSubdivisionHomotopyLinearMap` the one-step homotopy and
`sd^r = barycentricSubdivisionIterLinearMap`. Its chain-level boundary formula
`barycentricSubdivisionIter_boundary_formula` reads
`c - sd^N(c) = ∂(H^(N) c) + H^(N)(∂ c)`.

## Key geometric fact (carrier control)

The one-step homotopy `H([σ])` is the pushforward, along `σ`, of a *fixed*
universal chain `T_n` on the standard simplex `Δⁿ`. Therefore **every** simplex
appearing in `H([σ])` has image contained in `image(σ)`. Consequently, if `σ`
is `𝒰`-small then `H([σ])` is a `𝒰`-small chain; and the same holds for the
iterated homotopy, because `sd` also preserves smallness (carriers of a
subdivision summand lie inside the carrier of the original simplex).

The clean statement underlying all of this is:

* `singularChainMap_mem_smallChainSubmodule` — the pushforward of *any* chain
 along a continuous map `f` whose image lies inside a member of the cover is a
 small chain.

From it we deduce:

* `subdivisionHomotopy_preserves_smallChains` — the one-step homotopy `H` maps
 small chains to small chains.
* `iteratedSubdivisionHomotopy_preserves_smallChains` — the accumulated homotopy
 `H^(N)` maps small chains to small chains (for every `N`).

Finally we combine with the project (`exists_iteratedSubdivision_chain_mem_smallChains`):

* `exists_iteratedSubdivision_homotopy_mem_smallChains` — for every chain `c`
 there is `N` such that `sd^N(c)` is small and the homotopy term of the small
 subdivided chain `H^(N)(sd^N c)` is small.
* `exists_iteratedSubdivision_homotopy_boundary_mem_smallChains` — the injectivity
 tool: if `b` has a small boundary `z = ∂b` (e.g. `z` is a small cycle bounding
 `b` globally), then there is `N` with both `sd^N(b)` small and the homotopy
 chain `H^(N)(z)` small. By the boundary formula these are exactly the chains
 needed to rewrite `z` as a boundary inside the small subcomplex.

## Faithfulness note

For an *arbitrary* (non-small) chain `c`, the homotopy term `H^(N)(c)` is **not**
small: the boundary formula forces `∂(H^(N) c) + H^(N)(∂ c) = c - sd^N(c)`, so the
carriers of `H^(N)(c)` must cover the carriers of `c` itself. This is why the
`exists`-theorems control the homotopy term of the *subdivided/small* chain (resp.
of the small boundary `z`), which is exactly what the project require; we do not
state the (false) claim that `H^(N)(c)` is small for arbitrary `c`.

**Carrier control / pushforward smallness.** If a continuous map `f : Y ⟶ X`
has image contained in a member `U` of the open cover `𝒰` of `X`, then the
pushforward `f_#(c)` of *any* singular chain `c` on `Y` is a `𝒰`-small chain on
`X`: every basis simplex `σ` appearing in `c` is pushed to `f ∘ σ`, whose image
lies in `image(f) ⊆ U`.

**Subdivision-and-homotopy smallness.** For every chain `c` there is `N` with
`sd^N(c)` small and the homotopy term of the (now small) subdivided chain,
`H^(N)(sd^N c)`, small.

form that is actually small. See the faithfulness note in the module docstring.)

**Injectivity tool: small boundary witness.** Suppose `b` is an `(n+1)`-chain
whose boundary `z = ∂b` is `𝒰`-small (for instance, `z` is a small cycle that
bounds `b` globally). Then there is `N` such that both

* `sd^N(b)` is a small `(n+1)`-chain, and
* the homotopy chain `H^(N)(z) = H^(N)(∂b)` relating `sd^N(z)` to `z` is a small
 `(n+1)`-chain.

Combined with the boundary formula
`z - sd^N(z) = ∂(H^(N) z) + H^(N)(∂ z)` (and `∂z = 0` when `z` is a cycle), these
are exactly the small chains needed to exhibit `z` as a boundary inside the small
subcomplex in the project.
