# The small-simplices theorem: small chains include as a quasi-isomorphism

For an open cover `𝒰` of a space `X`, the inclusion chain map
`smallChainsInclusion R X 𝒰 : C_*^𝒰(X; R) ⟶ C_*(X; R)` of small singular chains
into all singular chains is a **quasi-isomorphism**: it induces an isomorphism on
homology in every degree.

This is the classical **small-simplices theorem** (a key step towards singular
Mayer–Vietoris and excision). It is assembled here from the two halves proved
earlier:

* `smallChainsInclusion_surjective_on_homology` (surjectivity on homology, every
 full homology class has a small representative via iterated barycentric
 subdivision), and
* `smallChainsInclusion_injective_on_homology` (injectivity on homology, a small
 cycle that bounds in the full complex already bounds in the small complex after
 a small homotopy correction).

Together they show the induced map on homology is bijective in every degree, hence
an isomorphism of `ModuleCat`-modules, hence the chain map is a quasi-isomorphism.

## Main results

* `SphereOddDegree.smallChainsInclusion_bijective_on_homology` — the induced map on
 degree-`n` homology is bijective.
* `SphereOddDegree.smallChains_inclusion_homology_iso` — the degreewise statement:
 the induced homology map `HomologicalComplex.homologyMap` is an isomorphism.
* `SphereOddDegree.smallChains_homologyIso` — the explicit module isomorphism in
 every degree.
* `SphereOddDegree.smallChains_inclusion_quasiIso` — the official **small-simplices
 theorem**: `smallChainsInclusion R X 𝒰` is a quasi-isomorphism.
