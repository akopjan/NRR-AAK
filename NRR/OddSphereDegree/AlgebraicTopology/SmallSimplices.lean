# Open-cover-small singular simplices

This file introduces the notion that a singular simplex of a space `X` is
*small with respect to an open cover* of `X`: its image is contained in one of
the open sets of the cover.

We work with the library's existing singular simplex API
(`SphereOddDegree.singularSimplices`), whose underlying continuous map out of
the topological standard simplex `Delta n` is recovered by
`SphereOddDegree.AffineBarycentricSubdivision.singularSimplexAsContinuousMap`.
No parallel singular-simplex type is introduced.

## Main definitions

* `SphereOddDegree.OpenCoverData X` — a family of open subsets of `X` that
 covers `X`.
* `SphereOddDegree.IsSmallSimplex 𝒰 σ` — the predicate that the image (range) of
 the singular simplex `σ` is contained in some member of the cover `𝒰`.

## Main results

* `SphereOddDegree.IsSmallSimplex.of_range_subset` — smallness is inherited
 along any range inclusion of the underlying continuous maps.
* `SphereOddDegree.IsSmallSimplex.comp_of_range_subset` — if `τ = σ ∘ φ` for a
 continuous map `φ : Delta m → Delta n`, then smallness of `σ` implies
 smallness of `τ`.
* `SphereOddDegree.IsSmallSimplex.face` — every boundary face of a small simplex
 is small.

This file deliberately does **not** prove smallness of barycentric subdivision;
that belongs to downstream modules.
