# The antipodal quotient is a covering map

This file establishes that the projection `proj n : S^n → RP n` is a covering
map: the canonical double cover of real projective space by the sphere.

The argument uses the fact that the cyclic group
`DeckGroup = Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` acts freely and (because it is finite
acting on a Hausdorff space) properly discontinuously on the sphere by the
antipodal involution, whose orbit relation is exactly the relation defining
`RP n`. Mathlib's
`MulAction.isQuotientCoveringMap_of_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`
then yields that the quotient projection is a covering map.

## Main results

* `proj_isCoveringMap` — `proj n` is a covering map;
* `proj_isLocalHomeomorph` — hence a local homeomorphism;
* `proj_isCoveringMap_two_sheeted` — `proj n` is a covering map *and* every
 fiber has exactly two elements (the "canonical double cover" packaged).

These covering-theoretic statements are the only public declarations of this
file.

The purely quotient-relation facts about the fibers of `proj n` (the membership
criterion `proj_eq_iff`, the fiber `proj_fiber x = {x, -x}`, and its
two-element cardinality `proj_fiber_ncard`/`proj_fiber_encard`/`proj_two_sheeted`)
live in `RealProjectiveSpace.lean`, since they need no covering-space machinery.

## Implementation notes

`DeckGroup` is the order-two deck-transformation group of the cover. We model
it as `Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` so that it is a genuine (multiplicative) group
and `MulAction`/`IsCancelSMul` apply directly.

The antipodal deck action of `DeckGroup` on `Sphere n` is pure scaffolding: it
exists only to discharge, by typeclass search, the hypotheses of the Mathlib
quotient-covering lemma at the one call site below. Nothing outside this file
consumes it, so the action (`DeckGroup`, the `SMul`/`MulAction`/
`ContinuousConstSMul`/`IsCancelSMul` instances, their defining equations, and the
orbit criterion `proj_eq_iff_mem_orbit`) is kept *out of the public surface*:
the four typeclass facts are `local instance`s (so they never pollute global
typeclass resolution downstream), and the supporting `abbrev`/lemmas are
`private`. The genuinely covering-theoretic public API is exactly
`proj_isCoveringMap` and `proj_isLocalHomeomorph`.

/-! ### The antipodal deck-transformation action

The order-two group `DeckGroup` acts on `Sphere n` by the antipodal involution.
These `local instance`s supply exactly the hypotheses (`MulAction`,
`ContinuousConstSMul`, `IsCancelSMul`) that the Mathlib quotient-covering lemma
discharges by typeclass search. They are local to this file: the action is only
needed to invoke that lemma, and is not part of the covering API. -/

/-! ### Local-homeomorphism consequences

The following are the standard consequences of `proj n` being a covering map /
local homeomorphism, specialised to the canonical double cover. -/

/-- `proj n` maps the neighborhood filter of `x` isomorphically onto the
neighborhood filter of `proj n x`: `(𝓝 x).map (proj n) = 𝓝 (proj n x)`. A direct
consequence of `proj n` being a local homeomorphism. -/
theorem proj_map_nhds_eq {n : ℕ} (x : Sphere n) :
    Filter.map (proj n) (nhds x) = nhds (proj n x) :=
  (proj_isLocalHomeomorph n).map_nhds_eq x

/-- `proj n` is locally injective: every point has a neighborhood on which the
projection is injective. A consequence of `proj n` being a local
homeomorphism. -/
theorem proj_isLocallyInjective (n : ℕ) :
    IsLocallyInjective (proj n : Sphere n → RP n) :=
  (proj_isLocalHomeomorph n).isLocallyInjective

/-- The fibers of the covering map `proj n` are discrete: each (two-element)
fiber `proj n ⁻¹' {q}` carries the discrete subspace topology. This is the
characteristic discreteness of fibers of a covering map; here it follows from
finiteness of the fiber in the Hausdorff sphere. -/
theorem proj_fiber_discreteTopology {n : ℕ} (q : RP n) :
    DiscreteTopology (proj n ⁻¹' {q} : Set (Sphere n)) :=
  have : Finite (proj n ⁻¹' {q} : Set (Sphere n)) := (proj_fiber_finite q).to_subtype
  inferInstance

/-- The projection `proj n : S^n → RP n` is a two-sheeted covering map: it is a
covering map and every fiber has exactly two elements. This packages the
covering-map property with the fiber-cardinality fact
(`proj_fiber_encard_eq_two`) into the single statement "canonical double
cover". -/
theorem proj_isCoveringMap_two_sheeted (n : ℕ) :
    IsCoveringMap (proj n : Sphere n → RP n) ∧
      ∀ q : RP n, (proj n ⁻¹' {q}).encard = 2 :=
  ⟨proj_isCoveringMap n, proj_fiber_encard_eq_two⟩
