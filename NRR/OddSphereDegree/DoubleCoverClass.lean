# The canonical `ZMod 2` monodromy class of the double cover `S^n → RP n`

toward the canonical degree-one class

```text
α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)
```

associated with the double cover `proj n : S^n → RP n`.

## What is honestly constructed here

The covering / monodromy side of Route A is realised as a genuine, fully-proved
group homomorphism

```text
classifyingHom n x : FundamentalGroup (RP n) x →* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)
```

— the **monodromy classifying homomorphism** of the double cover. It is the
composite

```text
π₁(RP n, x) --projMonodromyHom--> Equiv.Perm (proj n ⁻¹' {x})
 --permToZMod2--> Multiplicative (ZMod 2)
```

where `projMonodromyHom` (from `Monodromy.lean`) is the genuine action of the
fundamental group on the two-element fibre, and `permToZMod2` is the parity
(`Equiv.Perm.sign` composed with `ℤˣ ≅ ZMod 2`) of a permutation of a finite
set. On the two-element fibre this parity records exactly whether a loop swaps
the two sheets of the cover, i.e. it *is* the classifying datum of the regular
`ZMod 2`-cover.

This homomorphism is the source datum from which `α` is obtained, in Route A, by
the **degree-one universal coefficient theorem**
`H¹(X; F₂) ≅ Hom(π₁(X)ᵃᵇ, F₂)`. That theorem is **absent** from the pinned
Mathlib, so an honest `α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)` cannot yet be produced; this file
therefore stops exactly at the last formalized object before `α`, plus the
`H¹` target abbreviations, with **

## Monodromy → `ZMod 2`

* `intUnitsToZMod2` — the canonical isomorphism `ℤˣ →* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)`.
* `permToZMod2` — the parity homomorphism `Equiv.Perm α →* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)`
 for a finite `α`.
* `classifyingHom n x` — the monodromy classifying homomorphism
 `π₁(RP n, x) →* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` of the double cover.

## Naturality under descended odd maps

* `classifyingHom_inducedOnRP_naturality` — the descended odd map `fbar` acts
 trivially on the classifying homomorphism:
 `classifyingHom n (fbar x) ∘ (π₁ map fbar) = classifyingHom n x`. This is the
 fundamental-group form of the eventual `fbar^*(α) = α`.

On a *two-element* type the parity homomorphism `permToZMod2` is not merely a
homomorphism but a **bijection**: there are exactly two permutations of a
two-element set (the identity and the swap) and exactly two values in `ZMod 2`,
and parity distinguishes them. This is the canonical, choice-free identification
`Equiv.Perm α ≃* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` for `Nat.card α = 2` underlying the
`ZMod 2`-valued monodromy character: it shows the character loses no information
about the two-sheet monodromy. -/

/-! ## The two-sheet dichotomy and faithfulness of the classifying character

Because every fibre of `proj n` has exactly two elements
(`proj_fiber_nat_card_eq_two`), the abstract two-point facts above apply to the
monodromy permutation of a loop: it either fixes both sheets (trivial monodromy)
or swaps them, and the `ZMod 2`-valued classifying character records exactly
this dichotomy with no loss of information. -/

/-- **Two-sheet dichotomy of the monodromy.** For a loop `γ` at `x`, the
monodromy permutation of the two-element fibre is either the identity (the loop
preserves both sheets of the cover) or fixed-point-free (the loop swaps the two
sheets). This is `perm_two_eq_one_or_fixedpointfree` applied to the fibre, whose
cardinality is two. -/

/-- **Faithfulness of the classifying character.** The classifying character is
trivial on a class `a` iff the monodromy permutation of its underlying loop is
the identity: the `ZMod 2` value loses no information about the two-sheet
monodromy. (This uses `permToZMod2_eq_one_iff` on the two-element fibre.) -/
