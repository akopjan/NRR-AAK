# Conditional odd-map cohomological comparison

Assembles the reusable implication from explicit RP cohomology generator, cup-power,
transfer/naturality, and mod-two degree data to odd integer degree. These conditional interfaces
are used by later assembly modules; the stable public theorem is the unconditional endpoint in
`SphereOddDegree.Final`.

/-- **Conditional mod-2 degree comparison from the top class.**

Given a top class `a ∈ Hⁿ(RPⁿ; F₂)` that is fixed by the descended odd map
(`fbar^* a = a`) and whose double-cover image `proj^* a` is a nonzero element of
`Hⁿ(Sⁿ; F₂)`, the *only* remaining input is the **top-class / degree comparison**
`hcmp`: that `f^*` fixing the nonzero sphere top class forces
`degree f ≡ 1 (mod 2)`. Under that input the mod-2 degree is `1`.

The genuine work — pushing `fbar^* a = a` to `f^*(proj^* a) = proj^* a` via the
double-cover naturality square — is done by `spherePullback_fixes_projPullback`;
`hcmp` then consumes that fact. -/

/-- **Conditional final odd-map degree theorem from the full cohomological
chain.** This is the assembled conditional version of

```text

with the cohomological inputs as explicit hypotheses. Concretely:

* `alpha` — the degree-one class `α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)`;
* `alphaPow` — the top class `αⁿ ∈ Hⁿ(RPⁿ; F₂)`;
* `hα_fixed` — `fbar^*(α) = α`, the action of the descended odd map on `α`;
* `hpow` — pullback preserves powers, `fbar^*(α)=α ⇒ fbar^*(αⁿ)=αⁿ`;
* `hne` — `proj^* αⁿ ≠ 0`, the nonvanishing of the top class on the sphere;
* `hcmp` — the top-class / degree comparison.

The internal step `fbar^*(αⁿ)=αⁿ ⇒ f^*(proj^* αⁿ)=proj^* αⁿ` follows from
`spherePullback_fixes_projPullback`, and the parity bridge yields the final oddness statement. -/

/-! ## 3b. Conditional final theorem from the single ring-bridge hypothesis -/

/-- **Conditional final odd-map degree theorem from the single ring-bridge
hypothesis.** This is the same conclusion as
`oddMap_degree_odd_of_cohomological_inputs`, but with the four separate RPⁿ-side
inputs (`alpha`, `alphaPow`, `hpow`, and the RPⁿ-level nonvanishing `αⁿ ≠ 0`)
replaced by the **single** model-side ring-bridge hypothesis
`Φ : RPnCohomologyToModelHom n` (`RPnCohomologyRingBridge.lean`).

Given the bridge `Φ`:

* the degree-one class is `α := Φ.alpha ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)`;
* the top class is its `n`-th cup power `αⁿ := cupPowZMod2 Φ.alpha n ∈ Hⁿ(RPⁿ; F₂)`;
* the step `fbar^*(α) = α ⇒ fbar^*(αⁿ) = αⁿ` is discharged automatically by the
 proved cohomology-level cup-power naturality
 (`rpAlpha_power_top_fixed_ne_zero`), and `αⁿ ≠ 0` is supplied by the bridge as
 well, so neither needs to be assumed separately.

The only remaining inputs are the genuinely sphere and degree side ones: the action
hypothesis `hα_fixed` (`fbar^*(α) = α`, gated on the degree-one UCT identifying
`α`), the sphere nonvanishing `hne`, and the top-class/degree comparison `hcmp`.
Thus the RPⁿ top-class story is reduced to the one explicit input `Φ`. -/

/-! ## 3c. The single required input, packaged as one named comparison

Everything above keeps the genuine *topological* coefficient-reduction / top-class
comparison as a per-call hypothesis `hcmp`. We now isolate it once and for all as a
single named predicate `ModTwoTopClassComparison e`, uniform over **all** sphere
self-maps and **all** nonzero top `F₂`-classes. The final odd-map theorem then
follows from this one input together with the *proved* unconditional ingredients
(the double-cover naturality core `spherePullback_fixes_projPullback` and the
parity bridge `degreeOfIso_intCast_zmodTwo_eq_one_iff_odd`), with **no extra
parity assumptions**. This is the exact form of the required input. -/

/-- **The mod-two top-class / degree comparison.** This interface packages the
coefficient-reduction statement consumed by the conditional assembly. Relative to a chosen identification
`e : SphereTopHomologyIso n` (which fixes the integer degree `degreeOfIso e`), it
asserts: whenever a self-map `f` of `Sⁿ` **fixes a nonzero top class**
`c ∈ Hⁿ(Sⁿ; F₂)` (`f^* c = c`, `c ≠ 0`), its integer degree is **odd mod 2**
(`(degree f : ZMod 2) = 1`).

It states that the action on a nonzero top mod-two cohomology class determines
the parity of the integer degree. Downstream coefficient-reduction modules
construct this comparison. -/
def ModTwoTopClassComparison {n : ℕ} (e : SphereTopHomologyIso n) : Prop :=
  ∀ (f : C(Sphere n, Sphere n)) (c : sphereCohomology n n),
    spherePullback f n c = c → c ≠ 0 → (degreeOfIso e f : ZMod 2) = 1

/-! ### Reduction of the comparison to the top `F₂`-homology scalar action

The comparison `ModTwoTopClassComparison e` is here reduced — fully formalized,
using only the library's *proved* universal-coefficient machinery over `F₂`
(`kroneckerMap_naturality_apply` and `kroneckerMap_injective`) — to the single,
precise statement that the `F₂` pushforward on the top homology `Hₙ(Sⁿ; F₂)` acts
as the scalar `(degree f mod 2)`. This isolates the exact homological scalar statement from which the comparison
follows. -/

/-- **The top `F₂`-homology scalar action.** Relative to a chosen integral
identification `e : SphereTopHomologyIso n`, this asserts that the `F₂` homology
pushforward `f_* : Hₙ(Sⁿ; F₂) → Hₙ(Sⁿ; F₂)` of every self-map `f` acts as the
scalar `(degreeOfIso e f : ZMod 2)`.

Mathematically this is the conjunction of (i) `Hₙ(Sⁿ; F₂)` being one-dimensional
over `F₂` (so `f_*` is a scalar) and (ii) that scalar being the mod-`2` reduction
of the integer degree (coefficient-change compatibility `Hₙ(-;ℤ)⊗F₂ → Hₙ(-;F₂)`).
Downstream sphere-homology and coefficient-reduction modules prove this scalar
action for the canonical orientation. -/

/-- **The comparison follows from the top `F₂`-homology scalar action.** This is a
proved, formalized reduction: it derives `ModTwoTopClassComparison e` from
`ModTwoTopHomologyScalar e` using only the library's proved `F₂` universal
coefficient theorem (the Kronecker classifier's naturality and injectivity).

Given a self-map `f` fixing a nonzero top class `c ∈ Hⁿ(Sⁿ; F₂)`, the Kronecker
functional `ψ = ⟨c, ·⟩` is nonzero (injectivity) and `f_*`-invariant (naturality
plus `f^* c = c`); the scalar hypothesis turns invariance into `ψ z = d · ψ z`
for `d = degree f mod 2`, and since some `ψ z = 1` in `F₂` we get `d = 1`. -/

/-! ## 3d. conditional near-final assembly: three named blockers, no vacuous hypothesis

The theorems in §3b/§3c route the sphere-side nonvanishing through `projPullback`
(`proj^*`). That route is degenerate: for `n ≥ 1` one has `proj^* α = 0` in
`H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)`, hence `proj^*(αⁿ) = 0`, so the hypothesis `proj^* (αⁿ) ≠ 0` is
unsatisfiable and the genuine comparison really proceeds through the double-cover
*transfer*, not `proj^*`. The assembly below avoids that degenerate route
entirely: it depends on exactly three honest named blockers and no vacuous or
redundant hypothesis. -/

/-- **Odd self-maps fix a nonzero top `F₂`-class.** This packages the genuine
content of the RPⁿ / double-cover descent half of the argument: every odd
self-map `f` of `Sⁿ` fixes some nonzero class `c ∈ Hⁿ(Sⁿ; F₂)`
(`f^* c = c`, `c ≠ 0`).

Mathematically this holds because `f` descends to `fbar : RPⁿ → RPⁿ`, which acts
as the identity on the one-dimensional top group `Hⁿ(RPⁿ; F₂) = ⟨αⁿ⟩` (the unique
nonzero element is fixed by any ring map), and the double-cover *transfer*
homomorphism transports this to the nonzero sphere top class. This property is packaged as an explicit named input corresponding to the `F₂` transfer/Gysin
sequence of the double cover `Sⁿ → RPⁿ`. It is
**not** the degenerate `proj^*` route (`proj^*(αⁿ) = 0` for `n ≥ 1`). -/

assembled from exactly the three remaining named topological blockers — and with
**no vacuous or redundant hypothesis** (in particular it does *not* route through
the degenerate `proj^*` avatar, for which `proj^*(αⁿ) = 0` when `n ≥ 1`):

* `e : SphereTopHomologyIso n` — the integral top-homology identification
 `Hₙ(Sⁿ; ℤ) ≅ ℤ` that pins the integer degree `degreeOfIso e`; blocker branch
 *sphere top homology* (`SphereTopHomologyReduction.lean`);
* `hcmp : ModTwoTopClassComparison e` — a self-map fixing a nonzero top
 `F₂`-class has odd integer degree; blocker branch *mod-two degree comparison*
 (the `F₂`-coefficient transfer/reduction, `ModTwoDegreeComparison.lean`);
* `htop : OddMapFixesTopClass n` — an odd self-map fixes a nonzero top
 `F₂`-class; blocker branch *RPⁿ / double-cover descent* (the descended map acts
 trivially on `Hⁿ(RPⁿ; F₂)`, transported by the transfer).

Every other ingredient is the library's *proved, unconditional* machinery: the
parity bridge `degreeOfIso_intCast_zmodTwo_eq_one_iff_odd`. The oddness
hypothesis `hf` is used genuinely (it feeds `htop` to produce the fixed nonzero
top class). Supplying genuine terms for `e`, `hcmp`, `htop` specializes this to
the unconditional final theorem with no change of proof. -/

The theorems in §3–§3d keep the action of the descended odd map on the degree-one
class as an explicit hypothesis `hα_fixed : fbar^*(α) = α`. Using the genuine
class `rpAlpha n m` (`ConstructRPAlpha.lean`) built from a monodromy functional
`m : MonodromyFunctional n` (the degree-one homology functional interface), this
hypothesis is proved by `inducedOnRPPullback_rpAlpha`,

top power. The theorems below are the §3/§3c assemblies with the `hα_fixed`
hypothesis removed. -/
