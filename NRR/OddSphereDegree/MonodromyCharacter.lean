# The abelianized monodromy classifying character of the double cover

This file constructs the abelianized monodromy character associated with the canonical degree-one class

```text
α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂).
```

The conceptual classifier chain is

```text
monodromy of Sⁿ → RPⁿ
 → character π₁(RPⁿ, x) →* ZMod 2 (classifyingHom, DoubleCoverClass.lean)
 → character H₁(RPⁿ; ℤ) →* ZMod 2 (this file, via abelianization)
 → class α ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂) (degree-one cohomological classifier)
```

Since the target `Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` is abelian, the classifying
homomorphism `classifyingHom n x` factors **uniquely** through the abelianization
`Abelianization (FundamentalGroup (RP n) x)`. By the (degree-one) Hurewicz
theorem the abelianization of the fundamental group is the first integral
homology group `H₁(RP n; ℤ)`; the abelianized character is therefore exactly the
group-theoretic shadow of the `Hom(H₁, F₂)` side of the universal coefficient
theorem `H¹(X; F₂) ≅ Hom(H₁(X; ℤ), F₂)`. The character supplies the group-theoretic input to a degree-one cohomological classifier.

## Main declarations

* `classifyingHomAb n x` — the **abelianized monodromy classifying character**
 `Abelianization (FundamentalGroup (RP n) x) →* Multiplicative (ZMod 2)`.
* `classifyingHomAb_of` / `classifyingHomAb_comp_of` — it restricts to
 `classifyingHom` along `Abelianization.of` (factorisation).
* `classifyingHomAb_surjective` — for `n ≥ 1` it is surjective (nontriviality on
 the `H₁` side).
* `classifyingHomAb_inducedOnRP_naturality` — the descended odd map `fbar` acts
 trivially on the abelianized character, the `H₁`-level form of `fbar^*(α) = α`.

/-- The **abelianized monodromy classifying character** of the double cover
`proj n : S^n → RP n`. Because the target `Multiplicative (ZMod 2)` is abelian,
the classifying homomorphism `classifyingHom n x` factors uniquely through the
abelianization of `π₁(RP n, x)`. By the degree-one Hurewicz theorem the
abelianization of the fundamental group is the first integral homology
`H₁(RP n; ℤ)`, so this is the group-theoretic shadow of the `Hom(H₁, F₂)` side of
the universal coefficient theorem — the last honest object before `α`. -/

/-- **Surjectivity / nontriviality of the abelianized character.** For `n ≥ 1`,
the abelianized monodromy classifying character is surjective onto
`Multiplicative (ZMod 2)`. Equivalently, the abelianization of `π₁(RP n, x)`
(i.e. `H₁(RP n; ℤ)` by Hurewicz) has a nontrivial `ZMod 2`-valued character — the
honest nontriviality statement on the `H₁` side of Route A. -/

/-- **Naturality of the abelianized character under a descended odd map.** The
descended odd map `fbar = inducedOnRP f hf` acts trivially on the abelianized
monodromy classifying character:

```
This is the `H₁`-level form of the eventual cohomological identity `fbar^*(α) = α`;
it descends `classifyingHom_inducedOnRP_naturality` along `Abelianization.of`
using the uniqueness of the abelianized lift. -/
