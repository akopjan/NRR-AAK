# Bridge from RP singular cohomology to the truncated polynomial model

Defines explicit interfaces for maps from the actual mod-two cohomology of `RP n` to the model
`F₂[α]/(αⁿ⁺¹)` and derives nonvanishing and truncation consequences for cup powers. This module is
an intermediate model-comparison API; the final unconditional odd-degree proof uses the direct
cohomology-dimension-vanishing route.

/-- The **model-side half of the `RPⁿ` mod-two cohomology ring isomorphism**: a
graded ring homomorphism from the actual singular cohomology of `RPⁿ` to the
algebraic model `F₂[α]/(αⁿ⁺¹)`, carrying a chosen degree-one class to the model
generator `modelAlpha n`.

This is the honest, explicit, single hypothesis to which the top-class
nonvanishing `αⁿ ≠ 0` in `Hⁿ(RPⁿ; F₂)` is reduced. Concretely it bundles:

* a `ZMod 2`-linear map `toFun k : Hᵏ(RPⁿ; F₂) → F₂[α]/(αⁿ⁺¹)` in every degree;
* multiplicativity across degrees for the cup product
 (`toFun (p+q) (a ⌣ b) = toFun p a · toFun q b`);
* unitality (`toFun 0 1 = 1`);
* a chosen degree-one class `alpha ∈ H¹(RPⁿ; F₂)` with `toFun 1 alpha = modelAlpha n`.

Such a homomorphism is exactly what the classical ring isomorphism supplies on the
model side. -/

a graded ring homomorphism to the model (`RPnCohomologyToModelHom n`) that is, in

hypothesis" the design asks to reduce to: an injective graded ring map to the model
carrying `α` to `modelAlpha n` is exactly the model-side data of the isomorphism
`H^*(RPⁿ; F₂) ≅ F₂[α]/(αⁿ⁺¹)`, and it pins down the relation `αⁿ⁺¹ = 0` as well as

shape consumed by the final odd-degree comparison: `fbar^*(α) = α` forces
`fbar^*(αⁿ) = αⁿ`, while `αⁿ ≠ 0` makes that identity nontrivial. -/
