# The algebraic target ring `F₂[α] / (αⁿ⁺¹)` of the `RPⁿ` mod-two cohomology computation

The classical computation of the mod-two cohomology ring of real projective space
is the ring isomorphism

```text
H^*(RPⁿ; F₂) ≅ F₂[α] / (αⁿ⁺¹), deg α = 1.
```

This file builds the **right-hand side** — the *algebraic model* — as a genuine,
formalized Lean object together with the structural facts the final theorem
consumes, namely (on the model side):

* `αⁿ⁺¹ = 0` (the defining relation, the truncation);
* `αⁿ ≠ 0` (the top power is nonzero — the "top class" survives);
* more generally `αᵏ = 0 ↔ n+1 ≤ k` (exactly the powers below the truncation
 bound are nonzero), and the total `F₂`-dimension is `n+1`
 (`= Σₖ dim Hᵏ(RPⁿ; F₂)`).

Here the model ring is the genuine quotient polynomial ring

```text
RPnCohomologyRingModel n := (ZMod 2)[X] ⧸ (X^(n+1)),
```

and `modelAlpha n` is the residue class of `X` (the model of the degree-one
generator `α`). ** The bridge `H^*(RPⁿ; F₂) ≅ RPnCohomologyRingModel n`
remains genuinely open (it needs singular cohomology with a cup product that
descends to a graded ring, the degree-one universal coefficient class `α`, and
the cellular/inductive nonvanishing input — none of which exist in pinned
Mathlib; see

These model facts are nonetheless the precise *consequences* requested for the
final theorem (`αⁿ ≠ 0`, `αⁿ` is the top class, `αⁿ⁺¹ = 0`): under the ring isomorphism, they transport to
`H^*(RPⁿ; F₂)`.

/-- The **algebraic model** `F₂[α] / (αⁿ⁺¹)` of the mod-two cohomology ring of
`RPⁿ`, realized as the genuine quotient polynomial ring `(ZMod 2)[X] ⧸ (X^(n+1))`.

This is the right-hand side of the classical isomorphism
`H^*(RPⁿ; F₂) ≅ F₂[α]/(αⁿ⁺¹)`. The isomorphism itself to topological cohomology
is *not* asserted here (it remains open); only the model and its internal
structure are built. -/
