# Low-dimensional real projective space: `RP⁰`

This file records the genuine low-dimensional computations available in pinned
Mathlib for `RP⁰`, the base case of the `H^*(RPⁿ; F₂)` ring computation.

`RP⁰` is a single point: `Sphere 0` is the unit sphere in `ℝ¹`, which is the
two-point set `{±e}`, and the antipodal quotient identifies the two points. Hence
`RP⁰` is a `Subsingleton`, therefore `TotallyDisconnectedSpace`, and Mathlib's
`isZero_singularHomologyFunctor_of_totallyDisconnectedSpace` /
`singularHomologyFunctorZeroOfTotallyDisconnectedSpace` give its singular homology
outright:

```text
Hₙ(RP⁰; ℤ) = 0 (n ≠ 0), H₀(RP⁰; ℤ) ≅ ℤ.
```

These are honest, formalized computations: the only inputs are the point-set fact
`Subsingleton (RP 0)` (proved here from the library's `proj_eq_iff` and the
one-dimensional sphere geometry) and Mathlib's totally-disconnected homology API.

**Scope note.** This is the *homology* base case. The corresponding mod-two
*cohomology* base case `H^k(RP⁰; F₂) = 0 (k≠0)`, `H⁰(RP⁰; F₂) ≅ F₂` requires
dualizing the totally-disconnected chain complex through the library's
`singularCohomologyFunctor` (a contravariant `Hom(-, F₂)` of an exact-at-`n`
complex); pinned Mathlib has no off-the-shelf "dual of an exact complex is exact"
in this packaged form, so that step is the recorded next concrete theorem (see
cohomology computation is introduced.
