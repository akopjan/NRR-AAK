# Real projective space as an antipodal quotient

This file defines the first genuinely topological object in the library:

`RP n = S^n / (x ~ -x)`.

Implemented here:

* the antipodal equivalence relation on `Sphere n`;
* `RP n` as the quotient by that relation;
* the quotient projection `proj : Sphere n -> RP n` as a bundled continuous map;
* the quotient-map theorem for `proj`;
* descent of an odd map `f : Sphere n -> Sphere n` to `RP n -> RP n`;
* the basic commutative-square theorem, both pointwise and as a bundled
 continuous-map equality;
* a uniqueness theorem for the descended map;
* the fiber/relation API of `proj`: the membership criterion `proj_eq_iff`,
 the fiber `proj_fiber x = {x, -x}`, and the two-element cardinality of each
 fiber (`proj_fiber_ncard`, `proj_fiber_encard`, `proj_two_sheeted`). These
 depend only on the quotient relation, not on any covering-space machinery, so
 they live here next to the quotient rather than in `Covering.lean`.

/-! ### Deck transformations (informal sense)

A *deck transformation* of the double cover `proj n : S^n → RP n` is a
self-homeomorphism `φ` of `S^n` with `proj n ∘ φ = proj n`. Mathlib has no
standalone deck-transformation abstraction (no `DeckTransformation`/`deck`
declaration; only `IsCoveringMap` and the quotient-covering API built on
`MulAction`/`ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul`), so we record here only the two
elementary facts that the identity and the antipodal map are deck
transformations of `proj n`, in the bare `proj n ∘ φ = proj n` sense. No
abstract deck-transformation group is introduced. -/

/-- The antipodal map commutes with the projection: `proj n (antipodal n x) =
proj n x`. This is `proj_neg` phrased through the bundled antipodal map, and is
the pointwise statement that the antipodal map is a deck transformation of the
double cover `proj n`. -/

/-! ### Induction, recursion, and extensionality

Every point of `RP n` is `proj n x` for some sphere point `x`. The following
lemmas package the standard `Quotient` boilerplate (`Quotient.inductionOn`,
`Quotient.inductionOn₂`, `funext`/`ContinuousMap.ext`) specialized to `proj n`,
so that downstream proofs can reason directly in terms of the projection rather
than the underlying `Quotient.mk'`. -/

/-! ### Fibers of the projection

The fiber of `proj n` over `proj n x` is the antipodal pair `{x, -x}`, which
consists of two distinct points. These facts use only the quotient relation
(`Quotient.exact`/`Quotient.sound`, `proj_neg`) together with the sphere-level
fixed-point-free fact `ne_neg_self`; they require no covering-space machinery,
so they belong with the quotient definition rather than in `Covering.lean`. -/

representative and therefore has exactly two elements. These generalizations

The descended map `inducedOnRP f hf` is, by `inducedOnRP_comp_proj`, the unique
map making the square

```text

commute. The lemmas below extract from that square the *fiberwise* data that a
pullback-of-covers / monodromy-naturality argument consumes: the odd map `f`
carries the fiber over `q` into the fiber over `fbar q`
(`inducedOnRP_mapsTo_fiber`), the image of a whole fiber is exactly the target
fiber (`inducedOnRP_image_fiber`), and `f` is injective on each (two-element)
fiber (`inducedOnRP_injOn_fiber`). Together these say `f` restricts to a
bijection between the two-element fibers, which is precisely the
base-point-to-base-point compatibility the descended map needs to act on the
canonical double cover. These are pure quotient/point-set facts (they use only
`inducedOnRP_comm`, `proj_fiber`, and the oddness of `f`), so they live here
rather than in `Covering.lean`; no covering-space, classifying-map, or cohomology
machinery is involved. -/

/-- The descended map respects fibers: the odd map `f` carries the fiber over `q`
into the fiber over the descended image `inducedOnRP f hf q`. This is the
fiberwise form of the commuting square `inducedOnRP_comp_proj`, and the basic
input for treating `inducedOnRP f hf` as a map of the double cover by pullback. -/
