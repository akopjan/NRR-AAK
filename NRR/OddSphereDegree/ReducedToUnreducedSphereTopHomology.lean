# Reduced-to-unreduced bridge for sphere top homology

This file builds the **genuine** reduced-to-unreduced comparison for integral
singular homology and uses it to reduce the positive-dimensional sphere top-homology family to the corresponding *reduced* statement.

## Reduced homology, honestly

Pinned Mathlib (`v4.28.0`, commit `8f9d9cff6bd728b17a24e163c9402775d9e6a365`) has
**no** reduced-homology API, no suspension, no Mayer–Vietoris and no excision (see
than assume a reduced theory, we *define* reduced integral singular homology in the
standard way, as the kernel of the augmentation to a point:

```text
H̃ₙ(X; ℤ) := ker ( Hₙ(X; ℤ) --Hₙ(X → pt)--> Hₙ(pt; ℤ) ).
```

This is a legitimate definition of reduced homology (the kernel of the map induced
by the unique map to a one-point space), and it requires

## The bridge (proved)

For `n ≥ 1` the point has vanishing homology `Hₙ(pt; ℤ) = 0` (the one-point space
is totally disconnected, via Mathlib's
`isZero_singularHomologyFunctor_of_totallyDisconnectedSpace`). Hence the
augmentation `Hₙ(X) → Hₙ(pt)` is the zero map and its kernel is all of `Hₙ(X)`:

```text
n ≥ 1 ⇒ H̃ₙ(X; ℤ) ≅ Hₙ(X; ℤ). (`reducedToUnreducedIso`)
```

This is the exact reduced/unreduced comparison theorem requested by the project,
proved as an actual Lean isomorphism, not assumed.

## Consequence for the sphere top-homology family

Transporting along the bridge turns a *reduced* sphere top-homology computation
into the ordinary one consumed by the degree API:

```text
(∀ n ≥ 1, H̃ₙ(Sⁿ; ℤ) ≅ ℤ) ⇒ ∀ n ≥ 1, Hₙ(Sⁿ; ℤ) ≅ ℤ.
```

i.e. `sphereTopHomologyIsoPos_of_reducedSphereHomology`, and as a
`SphereOrientationPos` via `sphereOrientationPos_of_reducedSphereHomology`.

## Honest blocker recorded

In the *positive degree* regime reduced and unreduced homology **coincide** (this
file proves exactly that), so the bridge alone supplies no new computation: the
hypothesis `H̃ₙ(Sⁿ) ≅ ℤ` for `n ≥ 1` is, via the bridge, equivalent to the goal
`Hₙ(Sⁿ) ≅ ℤ`. The genuine content needed to *discharge* that reduced hypothesis is
the **reduced suspension isomorphism** `H̃ₖ(Sⁿ) ≅ H̃ₖ₋₁(Sⁿ⁻¹)` (with base
`H̃₀(S⁰) ≅ ℤ`), which rests on Mayer–Vietoris / excision and is absent from pinned
Mathlib. Consequently `SphereSuspensionTower.step` is **not** fillable from this
choice`, `Quot.sound`).
