# `NRR.Partition.ConvexPartition` — the shared convex‑partition structure

This module defines the single, shared `ConvexPartition` structure used by all later
fair‑partition modules, together with the basic cover/subset/area API needed before area
additivity can be developed.

The structure is stated over the **unified public body type** `NRR.Body`, which is a
definitional alias of `NRR.Geometry.ConvexBody NRR.E2 = ConvexBody Plane`
(`E2 = Geometry.Plane`). No independent convex‑body API is introduced here.

## Hypotheses

The partition records exactly the data needed for **finite measure additivity** of the area
functional:

* `subset` — each piece is contained in `K`;
* `covers` — the pieces cover `K`;
* `nullOverlap` — distinct pieces overlap only on a Lebesgue‑null set.

Strict (set‑theoretic) disjointness is deliberately *not* required: null overlaps are exactly
what finite measure additivity needs and what power/Voronoi partitions actually satisfy.

## API

* `ConvexPartition.IsEqualArea` — all pieces have equal area.
* `ConvexPartition.iUnion_piece_eq` — the pieces union to `K` (as sets).
* `ConvexPartition.piece_subset` — each piece is a subset of `K`.
* `ConvexPartition.piece_area_nonneg` — each piece has nonnegative area.

Area additivity itself is intentionally *not* proved here.
