# `NRR.PowerDiagram.CellOverlap` — null overlap of distinct power cells

Two distinct **nondegenerate** power (Laguerre) cells overlap only on the radical hyperplane
(bisector) of the two sites, and this overlap is Lebesgue‑null; consequently their interiors
are disjoint.

The nondegeneracy hypothesis is `sepNormal s i j ≠ 0`, i.e. `s i ≠ s j` (the two sites are
distinct). Without it the theorem is *false*: if `s i = s j` and `w i = w j` then the two
cells coincide and their overlap has positive volume.

* `cell_inter_subset_bisector` — the overlap of two cells is contained in the bisector
 hyperplane `{x | ⟪sepNormal s i j, x⟫ = sepOffset s w i j}`.
* `cell_inter_null` — the overlap of two distinct nondegenerate cells is Lebesgue‑null.
* `interior_cell_disjoint` — distinct nondegenerate cells have disjoint interiors.

The ambient type is the library alias `E2 = Geometry.Plane = EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)`
(this is the `Plane` referred to in the design).
