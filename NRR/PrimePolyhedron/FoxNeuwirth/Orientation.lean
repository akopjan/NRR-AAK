# Orientations for Fox--Neuwirth cells

This file chooses a concrete orientation for every barred-permutation cell.  The choice is the
parity of the inversion number of the displayed permutation.  We avoid quotienting orientations:
the chosen sign is an integer equal to `1` or `-1`, and relabelling is recorded by an explicit
orientation-transport sign.

The transport sign is deliberately part of the API.  A signed incidence matrix is not invariant
under an arbitrary change of chosen cell orientations; it is covariant by the product of the two
transport signs.  This is the correct datum needed by the later cellular mod-`p` argument.
