# Oriented Fox--Neuwirth facet incidences

The cells are all barred permutations.  A codimension-one incidence is supported exactly on the
facet relation.  Its sign is the product of the chosen orientations of the two incident cells.
This gives a concrete finite signed incidence matrix.  Under relabelling it transforms by the two
orientation-transport signs, while its unsigned support is strictly invariant.

This module records the oriented cell model and its boundary relation. The cycle and boundary-
cancellation results are proved in the chain modules.
